# WebForge is .. uh...
As you can tell by the fact that the last update was in early august and im writing this in late november, Webforge is kinda. well, I'm not fully scrapping it, but at the moment it's not being developed; it probably won't be developed the same way as it was originally intended, as a webgame, if I *do* decide to pick it up again. If you somehow stumble across this repo in the future and want, for some reason, to continue the project as it was, feel free to! I doubt anyone will, but hey, I won't stand in the way if you happen to have the unfortunate curse of Getting Obsessed With Some Niche Thing That Nobody Knows About And The Creator Left To Get Milk. I have trudged that battlefield so many times...

The rest of this README file is preserved as it was. WebForge is officially considered on "indefinite hiatus" as of November 20th, 2025.

Webforge (name is a work in progress) is a project in the works, the idea being to both really dip my hands in to javascript as well as develop my first actual game. Granted, it will most likely be a browser game, but still a game regardless. As the project develops, I'll update this repository. For now, here's some fun info because wow i really havent done anything like this before and have nooo clue what to do here

I currently don't have a precise roadmap, but here's a vague notion of things I'd like to accomplish at minimum with this project:
- [x] At least 10 metals to forge with (10/10)
- [x] At least 5 'blueprints'/weapons/tools to forge (5/5)
- [ ] A balanced difficulty/grind that is easy to learn but requires at least a little time commitment to finish
- [ ] A save/load system
- [ ] Actual audio and sfx
- [ ] A pronoun/name system if it ends up being needed
- [ ] Adjustable settings

And, similar to above, things I think would be *nice* to add but will take a significant enough amount of commitment that I'm not setting anything in stone yet:
- Enchantments
- Fluctuating "stock market" that impacts both costs of supply as well as how much your projects sell for
- A time/day system with a very simple energy/task management system, as well as events/items/etc only obtainable at certain times
- An optional hard mode after you reach a certain point that. well. i mean its self explanatory it makes the game harder
- Cosmetics/decor for your forge, maybe works with enchantments so that you can decorate how you want without sacrificing upgrades.
  - Customizable items might be likeee. The anvil, your hammer, rug/carpet/flooring, maybe some furniture? not sure, i plan to have the forge be a top-down view so it'll take some thinking

 Also, shout-out to some inspirations for this project: All of the gamerias from Flipline Studios; Forge a Weapon! on Roblox by CekTek studios, which I played one time and got so pissed at the seemingly random sell prices that it made me try to learn Lua and subsequently to start this entire project because I got frustrated. Oh, and any feedback anyone has ever given on my code-- Seriously, I may do this for fun, but seeing people actually interact with things I make??? wild. flabbergasted.
