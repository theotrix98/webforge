Webforge (name is a work in progress) is a project in the works, the idea being to both really dip my hands in to javascript as well as develop my first actual game. Granted, it will most likely be a browser game, but still a game regardless. As the project develops, I'll update this repository. For now, here's some fun info because wow i really havent done anything like this before and have nooo clue what to do here

I currently don't have a precise roadmap, but here's a vague notion of things I'd like to accomplish at minimum with this project:
- At least 10 metals to forge with (currently have 1/10)
- At least 5 'blueprints'/weapons/tools to forge
- A balanced difficulty/grind that is easy to learn but requires at least a little time commitment to finish
- A save/load system
- Actual audio and sfx
- A pronoun/name system if it ends up being needed
- Adjustable settings

And, similar to above, things I think would be *nice* to add but will take a significant enough amount of commitment that I'm not setting anything in stone yet:
- Enchantments
- Fluctuating "stock market" that impacts both costs of supply as well as how much your projects sell for
- A time/day system with a very simple energy/task management system, as well as events/items/etc only obtainable at certain times
- An optional hard mode after you reach a certain point that. well. i mean its self explanatory it makes the game harder
- Cosmetics/decor for your forge, maybe works with enchantments so that you can decorate how you want without sacrificing upgrades.
  - Customizable items might be likeee. The anvil, your hammer, rug/carpet/flooring, maybe some furniture? not sure, i plan to have the forge be a top-down view so it'll take some thinking

 Also, shout-out to some inspirations for this project: All of the gamerias from Flipline Studios; Forge a Weapon! on Roblox by CekTek studios, which I played one time and got so pissed at the seemingly random sell prices that it made me try to learn Lua and subsequently to start this entire project because I got frustrated. Oh, and any feedback anyone has ever given on my code-- Seriously, I may do this for fun, but seeing people actually interact with things I make??? wild. flabbergasted.
